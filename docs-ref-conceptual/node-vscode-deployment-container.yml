    This tutorial demonstrates how to deploy a Node.js application in a custom Docker container to Azure App Service using [Visual Studio Code extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode).

    Before you begin, make sure you have the following items:

    - [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    - [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
    - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
    - [Node Pack for Azure](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack) for Visual Studio Code
- title: Prepare a Resource Group and Container Registry
  durationInMinutes: 5

    To begin, ensure you have a container registry created. If you need to create a new registry, follow the steps in [Create a container registry using the Azure CLI](/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-azure-cli). As you go through the steps to create a registry, **be sure not to delete the resource group** as described in the [**Clean up resources**](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-azure-cli#clean-up-resources) section. You need a resource group in the following steps of this tutorial.

    If you have an existing resource group and container registry available for use, then proceed to the next section.

    Visual Studio Code makes it easy to create a container for your application. 

    Open the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + P`) and enter `> Docker: Add Docker files to workspace` and follow the prompts.

    The prompts ask you to select a platform as well as the port where the application is available.
