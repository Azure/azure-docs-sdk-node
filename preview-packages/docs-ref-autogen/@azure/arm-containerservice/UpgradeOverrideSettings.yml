    summary: >-
      Until when the overrides are effective. Note that this only matches the
      start time of an upgrade, and the effectiveness won't change once an
      upgrade starts even if the `until` expires as upgrade proceeds. This field
      is not set by default. It must be set for the overrides to take effect.
