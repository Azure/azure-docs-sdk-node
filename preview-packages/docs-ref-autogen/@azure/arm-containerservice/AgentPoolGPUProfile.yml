      Specify the type of GPU driver to install when creating Windows agent
      pools. If not provided, AKS selects the driver based on system
      compatibility. This cannot be changed once the AgentPool has been created.
      This cannot be set on Linux AgentPools. For Linux AgentPools, the driver
      is selected based on system compatibility.

      The default value is true when the vmSize of the agent pool contains a
      GPU, false otherwise. GPU Driver Installation can only be set true when VM
      has an associated GPU resource. Setting this field to false prevents
      automatic GPU driver installation. In that case, in order for the GPU to
      be usable, the user must perform GPU driver installation themselves.
