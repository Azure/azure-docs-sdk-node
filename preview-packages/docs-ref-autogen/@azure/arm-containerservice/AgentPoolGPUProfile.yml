      The default value is true when the vmSize of the agent pool contains a
      GPU, false otherwise. GPU Driver Installation can only be set true when VM
      has an associated GPU resource. Setting this field to false prevents
      automatic GPU driver installation. In that case, in order for the GPU to
      be usable, the user must perform GPU driver installation themselves.
