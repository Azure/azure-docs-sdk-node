      The set of options to configure the behavior of an `EventHubConsumer`.

      These can be specified when creating the consumer using the
      `createConsumer` method.

      - `ownerLevel`  : A number indicating that the consumer intends to be an
      exclusive consumer of events resulting in other

      consumers to fail if their `ownerLevel` is lower or doesn't exist.

      - `retryOptions`: The retry options used to govern retry attempts when an
      issue is encountered while receiving events.

      A simple usage can be `{ "maxRetries": 4 }`.

      Example usage:

      ```js

      {
          retryOptions: {
              maxRetries: 4
          },
          trackLastEnqueuedEventInfo: false
      }

      ```

    summary: >-
      The owner level associated with an exclusive consumer.


      When provided, the owner level indicates that a consumer is intended to be
      the exclusive receiver of events for the

      requested partition and the associated consumer group.

      When multiple consumers exist for the same partition/consumer group pair,
      then the ones with lower or no

      `ownerLevel` will get a `ReceiverDisconnectedError` during the next
      attempted receive operation.

      Indicates whether or not the consumer should request information on the
      last enqueued event on its

      associated partition, and track that information as events are received.


      When information about the partition's last enqueued event is being
      tracked, each event received

      from the Event Hubs service will carry metadata about the partition that
      it otherwise would not. This results in a small amount of

      additional network bandwidth consumption that is generally a favorable
      trade-off when considered

      against periodically making requests for partition properties using the
      Event Hub client.
