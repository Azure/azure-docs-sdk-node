      Indicates whether or not the consumer should request information on the
      last enqueued event on its

      associated partition, and track that information as events are received.


      When information about the partition's last enqueued event is being
      tracked, each event received

      from the Event Hubs service will carry metadata about the partition that
      it otherwise would not. This results in a small amount of

      additional network bandwidth consumption that is generally a favorable
      trade-off when considered

      against periodically making requests for partition properties using the
      Event Hub client.
