      This is the average hourly utilization for each date range that
      corresponds to given grain (Daily, Monthly). Suppose the API call is for
      usageDate > 2022-10-01 and usageDate < 2022-10-31 at a daily granularity.
      There will be one record per benefit id for each day. For a single day,
      the avgUtilizationPercentage value will be equal to the average of the set
      of values where the set contains 24 utilization percentage entries one for
      each hour in a specific day.
