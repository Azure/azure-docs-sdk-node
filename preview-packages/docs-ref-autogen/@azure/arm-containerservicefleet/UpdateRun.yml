      two or more entities from the same requested resource. HTTP/1.1 uses
      entity tags in the etag (section 14.19), If-Match (section 14.24),
      If-None-Match (section 14.26), and If-Range (section 14.27) header fields.

      The strategy defines the order in which the clusters will be updated.

      If not set, all members will be updated sequentially. The UpdateRun status
      will show a single UpdateStage and a single UpdateGroup targeting all
      members.

      The strategy of the UpdateRun can be modified until the run is started.

    package: '@azure/arm-containerservicefleet'
    summary: >-
      The resource id of the FleetUpdateStrategy resource to reference.


      When creating a new run, there are three ways to define a strategy for the
      run:

      1. Define a new strategy in place: Set the "strategy" field.

      2. Use an existing strategy: Set the "updateStrategyId" field. (since
      2023-08-15-preview)

      3. Use the default strategy to update all the members one by one: Leave
      both "updateStrategyId" and "strategy" unset. (since 2023-08-15-preview)


      Setting both "updateStrategyId" and "strategy" is invalid.


      UpdateRuns created by "updateStrategyId" snapshot the referenced
      UpdateStrategy at the time of creation and store it in the "strategy"
      field.

      Subsequent changes to the referenced FleetUpdateStrategy resource do not
      propagate.

      UpdateRunStrategy changes can be made directly on the "strategy" field
      before launching the UpdateRun.
