    summary: >-
      Video segment length indicates the length of individual video files
      (segments) which are persisted to storage. Smaller segments provide lower
      archive playback latency but generate larger volume of storage
      transactions. Larger segments reduce the amount of storage transactions
      while increasing the archive playback latency. Value must be specified in
      ISO8601 duration format (i.e. "PT30S" equals 30 seconds) and can vary
      between 30 seconds to 5 minutes, in 30 seconds increments. Changing this
      value after the video is initially created can lead to errors when
      uploading media to the archive. Default value is 30 seconds.
