      Default oversampling factor. Oversampling will internally request more
      documents (specified by this multiplier) in the initial search. This
      increases the set of results that will be reranked using recomputed
      similarity scores from full-precision vectors. Minimum value is 1, meaning
      no oversampling (1x). This parameter can only be set when
      rerankWithOriginalVectors is true. Higher values improve recall at the
      expense of latency.

      If set to true, once the ordered set of results calculated using
      compressed vectors are obtained, they will be reranked again by
      recalculating the full-precision similarity scores. This will improve
      recall at the expense of latency.
