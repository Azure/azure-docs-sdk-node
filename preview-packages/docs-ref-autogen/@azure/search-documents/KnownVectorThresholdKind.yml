      The results of the vector query will filter based on the '@search.score'
      value. Note this is the @search.score returned as part of the search
      response. The threshold direction will be chosen for higher @search.score.

    summary: >-
      The results of the vector query will be filtered based on the vector
      similarity metric. Note this is the canonical definition of similarity
      metric, not the 'distance' version. The threshold direction (larger or
      smaller) will be chosen automatically according to the metric used by the
      field.
