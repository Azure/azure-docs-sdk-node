    summary: >-
      Determines the maximum number of documents to be retrieved by the text
      query portion of a hybrid search request. Those documents will be combined
      with the documents matching the vector queries to produce a single final
      list of results. Choosing a larger maxTextRecallSize value will allow
      retrieving and paging through more documents (using the top and skip
      parameters), at the cost of higher resource utilization and higher
      latency. The value needs to be between 1 and 10,000. Default is 1000.
