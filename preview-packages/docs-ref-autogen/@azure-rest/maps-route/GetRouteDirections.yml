      The `Get Route Directions` API is an HTTP `GET` request that returns a
      route between an origin and a destination, passing through waypoints if
      specified. The route takes into account factors such as current traffic
      and the typical road speeds on the requested day of the week and time of
      day.


      Information returned includes the distance, estimated travel time, and a
      representation of the route geometry. Additional routing information such
      as optimized waypoint order or turn by turn instructions is also
      available, depending on the options selected.


      Routing service provides a set of parameters for a detailed description of
      a vehicle-specific consumption model. For more information, see
      [Consumption Model](/azure/azure-maps/consumption-model).
