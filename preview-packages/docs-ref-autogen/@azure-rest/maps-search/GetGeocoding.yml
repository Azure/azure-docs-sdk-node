    summary: >-
      The `Get Geocoding` API is an HTTP `GET` request that returns the
      longitude and latitude coordinates of the location being searched.


      In many cases, the complete search service might be too much, for instance
      if you are only interested in traditional geocoding. Search can also be
      accessed for address look up exclusively. The geocoding is performed by
      hitting the geocoding endpoint with just the address or partial address in
      question. The geocoding search index will be queried for everything above
      the street level data. No Point of Interest (POIs) will be returned. Note
      that the geocoder is very tolerant of typos and incomplete addresses. It
      will also handle everything from exact street addresses or street or
      intersections as well as higher level geographies such as city centers,
      counties and states. The response also returns detailed address properties
      such as street, postal code, municipality, and country/region information.
