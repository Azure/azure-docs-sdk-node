      The level of confidence that the geocoded location result is a match. Use
      this value with the match code to determine for more complete information
      about the match.


      The confidence of a geocoded location is based on many factors including
      the relative importance of the geocoded location and the userâ€™s location,
      if specified.

    summary: >-
      One or more match code values that represent the geocoding level for each
      location in the response.


      For example, a geocoded location with match codes of `Good` and
      `Ambiguous` means that more than one geocode location was found for the
      location information and that the geocode service did not have search
      up-hierarchy to find a match.


      Similarly, a geocoded location with match codes of `Ambiguous` and
      `UpHierarchy` implies that a geocode location could not be found that
      matched all the provided location information, so the geocode service had
      to search up-hierarchy and found multiple matches at that level. An
      example of up an `Ambiguous` and `UpHierarchy` result is when you provide
      complete address information, but the geocode service cannot locate a
      match for the street address and instead returns information for more than
      one RoadBlock value.


      The possible values are:


      `Good`: The location has only one match or all returned matches are
      considered strong matches. For example, a query for New York returns
      several Good matches.


      `Ambiguous`: The location is one of a set of possible matches. For
      example, when you query for the street address 128 Main St., the response
      may return two locations for 128 North Main St. and 128 South Main St.
      because there is not enough information to determine which option to
      choose.


      `UpHierarchy`: The location represents a move up the geographic hierarchy.
      This occurs when a match for the location request was not found, so a less
      precise result is returned. For example, if a match for the requested
      address cannot be found, then a match code of `UpHierarchy` with a
      RoadBlock entity type may be returned.
