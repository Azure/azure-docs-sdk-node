      Specify entity types that you want in the response. Only the types you
      specify will be returned. If the point cannot be mapped to the entity
      types you specify, no location information is returned in the response.

      Default value is all possible entities.

      A comma separated list of entity types selected from the following
      options.


      - Address

      - Neighborhood

      - PopulatedPlace

      - Postcode1

      - AdminDivision1

      - AdminDivision2

      - CountryRegion


      These entity types are ordered from the most specific entity to the least
      specific entity. When entities of more than one entity type are found,
      only the most specific entity is returned. For example, if you specify
      Address and AdminDistrict1 as entity types and entities were found for
      both types, only the Address entity information is returned in the
      response.
