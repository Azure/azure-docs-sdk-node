      An action that the Batch service performs on Tasks that depend on this
      Task. Possible values are 'satisfy' (allowing dependent tasks to progress)
      and 'block' (dependent tasks continue to wait). Batch does not yet support
      cancellation of dependent tasks.

    package: '@azure-rest/batch'
    summary: >-
      An action to take on the Job containing the Task, if the Task completes
      with the given exit condition and the Job's onTaskFailed property is
      'performExitOptionsJobAction'. The default is none for exit code 0 and
      terminate for all other exit conditions. If the Job's onTaskFailed
      property is noaction, then specifying this property returns an error and
      the add Task request fails with an invalid property value error; if you
      are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
      Request).
