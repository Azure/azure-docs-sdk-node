summary: |-
  Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node.
  Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an
  unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host failure.
  Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted
  against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal
  retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should
  be idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and
  restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice
  for long running Tasks is to use some form of checkpointing.
