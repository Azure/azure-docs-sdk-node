    summary: >-
      The blob prefix to use when downloading blobs from an Azure Storage
      container. Only the blobs whose names begin with the specified prefix will
      be downloaded. The property is valid only when autoStorageContainerName or
      storageContainerUrl is used. This prefix can be a partial filename or a
      subdirectory. If a prefix is not specified, all the files in the container
      will be downloaded.

    summary: >-
      The file permission mode attribute in octal format. This property applies
      only to files being downloaded to Linux Compute Nodes. It will be ignored
      if it is specified for a resourceFile which will be downloaded to a
      Windows Compute Node. If this property is not specified for a Linux
      Compute Node, then a default value of 0770 is applied to the file.

  - name: filePath
    uid: '@azure-rest/batch.ResourceFile.filePath'
    package: '@azure-rest/batch'
    summary: >-
      The location on the Compute Node to which to download the file(s),
      relative to the Task's working directory. If the httpUrl property is
      specified, the filePath is required and describes the path which the file
      will be downloaded to, including the filename. Otherwise, if the
      autoStorageContainerName or storageContainerUrl property is specified,
      filePath is optional and is the directory to download the files to. In the
      case where filePath is used as a directory, any directory structure
      already associated with the input data will be retained in full and
      appended to the specified filePath directory. The specified relative path
      cannot break out of the Task's working directory (for example by using
      '..').

      The URL of the file to download. The autoStorageContainerName,
      storageContainerUrl and httpUrl properties are mutually exclusive and one
      of them must be specified. If the URL points to Azure Blob Storage, it
      must be readable from compute nodes. There are three ways to get such a
      URL for a blob in Azure storage: include a Shared Access Signature (SAS)
      granting read permissions on the blob, use a managed identity with read
      permission, or set the ACL for the blob or its container to allow public
      access.
