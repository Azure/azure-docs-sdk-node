      This does not restore the Pool to its previous state before the resize

      operation: it only stops any further changes being made, and the Pool
      maintains

      its current state. After stopping, the Pool stabilizes at the number of
      Compute

      Nodes it was at when the stop operation was done. During the stop
      operation,

      the Pool allocation state changes first to stopping and then to steady. A

      resize operation need not be an explicit resize Pool request; this API can
      also

      be used to halt the initial sizing of the Pool when it is created.
