    summary: >-
      Reactivation makes a Task eligible to be retried again up to its maximum
      retry

      count. The Task's state is changed to active. As the Task is no longer in
      the

      completed state, any previous exit code or failure information is no
      longer

      available after reactivation. Each time a Task is reactivated, its retry
      count

      is reset to 0. Reactivation will fail for Tasks that are not completed or
      that

      previously completed successfully (with an exit code of 0). Additionally,
      it

      will fail if the Job has completed (or is terminating or deleting).
