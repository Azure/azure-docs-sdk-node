      The exit code of the program specified on the Task command line. This
      parameter is returned only if the Task is in the completed state. The exit
      code for a process reflects the specific convention implemented by the
      application developer for that process. If you use the exit code value to
      make decisions in your code, be sure that you know the exit code
      convention used by the application process. Note that the exit code may
      also be generated by the Compute Node operating system, such as when a
      process is forcibly terminated.
