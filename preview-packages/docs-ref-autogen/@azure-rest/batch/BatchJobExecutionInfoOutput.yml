    summary: >-
      The ID of the Pool to which this Job is assigned. This element contains
      the actual Pool where the Job is assigned. When you get Job details from
      the service, they also contain a poolInfo element, which contains the Pool
      configuration data from when the Job was added or updated. That poolInfo
      element may also contain a poolId element. If it does, the two IDs are the
      same. If it does not, it means the Job ran on an auto Pool, and this
      property contains the ID of that auto Pool.

    package: '@azure-rest/batch'
    summary: >-
      A string describing the reason the Job ended. This property is set only if
      the Job is in the completed state. If the Batch service terminates the
      Job, it sets the reason as follows: JMComplete - the Job Manager Task
      completed, and killJobOnCompletion was set to true. MaxWallClockTimeExpiry
      - the Job reached its maxWallClockTime constraint. TerminateJobSchedule -
      the Job ran as part of a schedule, and the schedule terminated.
      AllTasksComplete - the Job's onAllTasksComplete attribute is set to
      terminatejob, and all Tasks in the Job are complete. TaskFailed - the
      Job's onTaskFailure attribute is set to performExitOptionsJobAction, and a
      Task in the Job failed with an exit condition that specified a jobAction
      of terminatejob. Any other string is a user-defined reason specified in a
      call to the 'Terminate a Job' operation.
