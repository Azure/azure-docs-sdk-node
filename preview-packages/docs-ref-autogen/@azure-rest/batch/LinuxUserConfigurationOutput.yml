    summary: >-
      The SSH private key for the user Account. The private key must not be
      password protected. The private key is used to automatically configure
      asymmetric-key based authentication for SSH between Compute Nodes in a
      Linux Pool when the Pool's enableInterNodeCommunication property is true
      (it is ignored if enableInterNodeCommunication is false). It does this by
      placing the key pair into the user's .ssh directory. If not specified,
      password-less SSH is not configured between Compute Nodes (no modification
      of the user's .ssh directory is done).
