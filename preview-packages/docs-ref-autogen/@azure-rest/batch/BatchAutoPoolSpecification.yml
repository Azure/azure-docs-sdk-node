      A prefix to be added to the unique identifier when a Pool is automatically
      created. The Batch service assigns each auto Pool a unique identifier on
      creation. To distinguish between Pools created for different purposes, you
      can specify this element to add a prefix to the ID that is assigned. The
      prefix can be up to 20 characters long.

      Whether to keep an auto Pool alive after its lifetime expires. If false,
      the Batch service deletes the Pool once its lifetime (as determined by the
      poolLifetimeOption setting) expires; that is, when the Job or Job Schedule
      completes. If true, the Batch service does not delete the Pool
      automatically. It is up to the user to delete auto Pools created with this
      option.
