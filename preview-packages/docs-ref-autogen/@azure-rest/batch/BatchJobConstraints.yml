    summary: >-
      The maximum number of times each Task may be retried. The Batch service
      retries a Task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value
      specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try
      each Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the
      maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a Task up to 4 times (one initial
      try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service
      does not retry Tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
      retries Tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).

    summary: >-
      The maximum elapsed time that the Job may run, measured from the time the
      Job is created. If the Job does not complete within the time limit, the
      Batch service terminates it and any Tasks that are still running. In this
      case, the termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this
      property is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the Job may
      run.
