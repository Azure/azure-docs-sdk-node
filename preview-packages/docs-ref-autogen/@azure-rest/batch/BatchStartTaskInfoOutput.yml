      The time at which the StartTask stopped running. This is the end time of
      the most recent run of the StartTask, if that run has completed (even if
      that run failed and a retry is pending). This element is not present if
      the StartTask is currently running.

    package: '@azure-rest/batch'
    summary: >-
      The exit code of the program specified on the StartTask command line. This
      property is set only if the StartTask is in the completed state. In
      general, the exit code for a process reflects the specific convention
      implemented by the application developer for that process. If you use the
      exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that you know the
      exit code convention used by the application process. However, if the
      Batch service terminates the StartTask (due to timeout, or user
      termination via the API) you may see an operating system-defined exit
      code.

    package: '@azure-rest/batch'
    summary: >-
      The most recent time at which a retry of the Task started running. This
      element is present only if the Task was retried (i.e. retryCount is
      nonzero). If present, this is typically the same as startTime, but may be
      different if the Task has been restarted for reasons other than retry; for
      example, if the Compute Node was rebooted during a retry, then the
      startTime is updated but the lastRetryTime is not.

    package: '@azure-rest/batch'
    summary: >-
      The number of times the Task has been retried by the Batch service. Task
      application failures (non-zero exit code) are retried, pre-processing
      errors (the Task could not be run) and file upload errors are not retried.
      The Batch service will retry the Task up to the limit specified by the
      constraints.
