    summary: >-
      The maximum number of times the Task may be retried. The Batch service
      retries a Task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value
      specifically controls the number of retries for the Task executable due to
      a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the Task once, and may
      then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3,
      Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the
      maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task after
      the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
      retries the Task without limit, however this is not recommended for a
      start task or any task. The default value is 0 (no retries).

    summary: >-
      The maximum elapsed time that the Task may run, measured from the time the
      Task starts. If the Task does not complete within the time limit, the
      Batch service terminates it. If this is not specified, there is no time
      limit on how long the Task may run.

    summary: >-
      The minimum time to retain the Task directory on the Compute Node where it
      ran, from the time it completes execution. After this time, the Batch
      service may delete the Task directory and all its contents. The default is
      7 days, i.e. the Task directory will be retained for 7 days unless the
      Compute Node is removed or the Job is deleted.
