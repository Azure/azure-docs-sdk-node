    summary: >-
      An opaque string representing the location of a Compute Node or a Task
      that has run previously. You can pass the affinityId of a Node to indicate
      that this Task needs to run on that Compute Node. Note that this is just a
      soft affinity. If the target Compute Node is busy or unavailable at the
      time the Task is scheduled, then the Task will be scheduled elsewhere.
