    summary: >-
      How the Batch service should respond if the Task fails with an exit
      condition not covered by any of the other properties. This value is used
      if the Task exits with any nonzero exit code not listed in the exitCodes
      or exitCodeRanges collection, with a pre-processing error if the
      preProcessingError property is not present, or with a file upload error if
      the fileUploadError property is not present. If you want non-default
      behavior on exit code 0, you must list it explicitly using the exitCodes
      or exitCodeRanges collection.

      How the Batch service should respond if a file upload error occurs. If the
      Task exited with an exit code that was specified via exitCodes or

      specified by the exit code takes precedence.
