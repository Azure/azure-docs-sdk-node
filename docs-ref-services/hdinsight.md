# Azure HDInsight modules for Node.js

## Overview
Azure HDInsight is a cloud distribution of the Hadoop components from the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP). Apache Hadoop was the original open-source framework for distributed processing and analysis of big data sets on clusters of computers.

HDInsight makes Hadoop technologies easier to use, with:
- Less setup and configuration. See Provision Hadoop clusters in HDInsight.
- High availability and reliability. See HDInsight availability and reliability.
- Security and governance through integration with Active Directory. See Domain-joined clusters.
- Dynamic scaling without interrupting jobs
- Component updates and current versions. See Hadoop components and versions on HDInsight.
- Integration with other Azure services, including Web apps and SQL Database

The Hadoop technology stack includes related software and utilities, including Apache Hive, HBase, Spark, Kafka, and many others.
