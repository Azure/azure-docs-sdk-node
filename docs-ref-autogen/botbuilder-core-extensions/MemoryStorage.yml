    summary: ":package: **botbuilder-core-extensions**\r\rMemory based storage provider for a bot. This provider is most useful for simulating production\rstorage when running locally against the emulator or as part of a unit test. It has the\rfollowing characteristics:\r\r- Starts off completely empty when the bot is run.\r- Anything written to the store will be forgotten when the process exits.\r- Object that are read and written to the store are cloned to properly simulate network based\r  storage providers.\r- Cloned objects serialized using `JSON.stringify()` to catch any possible serialization related\r  issues that might occur when using a network based storage provider.\r\r**Usage Example**\r\r```JavaScript\rconst { MemoryStorage } = require('botbuilder');\r\rconst storage = new MemoryStorage();\r```"
