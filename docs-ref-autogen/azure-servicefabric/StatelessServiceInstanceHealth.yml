      Id of a stateless service instance. InstanceId is used by Service Fabric
      to uniquely identify

      an instance of a partition of a stateless service. It is unique within a
      partition and does

      not change for the lifetime of the instance. If the instance has failed
      over on the same or

      different node, it will get a different value for the InstanceId.
