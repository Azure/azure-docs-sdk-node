      The compensating action to perform when a Monitored upgrade encounters
      monitoring policy or

      Invalid indicates the failure action is invalid. Rollback specifies that
      the upgrade will

      start rolling back automatically.

      Manual indicates that the upgrade will switch to UnmonitoredManual upgrade
      mode. Possible

      values include: 'Invalid', 'Rollback', 'Manual'
