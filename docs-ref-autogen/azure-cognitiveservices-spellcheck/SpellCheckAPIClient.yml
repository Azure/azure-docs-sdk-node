      The Bing Spell Check API lets you perform contextual grammar and

      spell checking. Bing has developed a web-based spell-checker that
      leverages

      machine learning and statistical machine translation to dynamically train
      a

      constantly evolving and highly contextual algorithm. The spell-checker is

      based on a massive corpus of web searches and documents.

            A comma-delimited list of one or

            more languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in
            decreasing

            order of preference. For additional information, including expected
            format,

            see
            [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).
            This

            header and the setLang query parameter are mutually exclusive; do
            not

            specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify the cc
            query

            parameter. Bing will use the first supported language it finds from
            the

            list, and combine that language with the cc parameter value to
            determine the

            market to return results for. If the list does not include a
            supported

            language, Bing will find the closest language and market that
            supports the

            request, and may use an aggregated or default market for the results
            instead

            of a specified one. You should use this header and the cc query
            parameter

            only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should use
            the mkt

            and setLang query parameters. A user interface string is a string
            that's

            used as a label in a user interface. There are very few user
            interface

            strings in the JSON response objects. Any links in the response
            objects to

            Bing.com properties will apply the specified language.

            The user agent originating the request.

            Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized

            experience. Although optional, you are strongly encouraged to always
            specify

            this header. The user-agent should be the same string that any
            commonly used

            browser would send. For information about user agents, see [RFC

            2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).
          optional: true

          type:
            - string
          description: >-
            Bing uses this header to provide users

            with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights
            new

            features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for
            assigning

            traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID
            for a

            user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to
            multiple

            conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights
            can lead

            to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second
            request has a

            different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be

            unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results
            to that

            client IDâ€™s search history, providing a richer experience for the
            user. Bing

            also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing
            the

            activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help
            with

            better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables
            higher

            click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although
            optional, you

            should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID
            across

            multiple requests for the same end user and device combination
            enables 1)

            the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2)
            higher

            click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing
            APIs. Each

            user that uses your application on the device must have a unique,
            Bing

            generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the
            request, Bing

            generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response
            header. The

            only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is
            the first

            time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for
            each Bing

            API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist
            the

            client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP
            cookie

            to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session
            cookie.

            For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent
            storage to

            persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device,
            get the

            client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include
            this

            header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID
            and use

            it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If
            you

            include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the
            request.

            the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although

            optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the

            X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example,
            by

            changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in
            the

            location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which
            may

            result in Bing serving erroneous results.

            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value

            pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses
            the

            location information to determine safe search behavior and to return

            relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>.
            The

            following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location.
            lat

            (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The
            latitude

            must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to
            +90.0.

            Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values
            indicate

            northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's
            location,

            in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0
            and less

            than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes
            and

            positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The
            radius, in

            meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates.
            Pass the

            value returned by the device's location service. Typical values
            might be 22m

            for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for
            reverse IP

            lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was
            at the

            location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January
            1,

            1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction
            of

            travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through
            360,

            counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if
            the sp

            key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in
            meters

            per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The

            altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The
            radius, in

            meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates.
            Specify

            this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys
            are

            optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate
            the

            location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always

            specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is

            especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately
            reflect

            the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN).
            For

            optimal results, you should include this header and the 
            X-Search-ClientIP

            header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.

            to us. If

            you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language

      The Bing Spell Check API lets you perform contextual grammar and

      spell checking. Bing has developed a web-based spell-checker that
      leverages

      machine learning and statistical machine translation to dynamically train
      a

      constantly evolving and highly contextual algorithm. The spell-checker is

      based on a massive corpus of web searches and documents.

            This

            header and the setLang query parameter are mutually exclusive; do

            specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify the cc
            query

            parameter. Bing will use the first supported language it finds from
            the

            list, and combine that language with the cc parameter value to
            determine the

            market to return results for. If the list does not include a
            supported

            language, Bing will find the closest language and market that

            request, and may use an aggregated or default market for the results
            instead

            of a specified one. You should use this header and the cc query
            parameter

            only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should use
            the mkt

            and setLang query parameters. A user interface string is a string
            that's

            used as a label in a user interface. There are very few user

            objects to

            Bing.com properties will apply the specified language.

            Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized

            experience. Although optional, you are strongly encouraged to always
            specify

            this header. The user-agent should be the same string that any
            commonly used

            browser would send. For information about user agents, see [RFC

            2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).

          description: >-
            Bing uses this header to provide users

            with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights
            new

            features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for
            assigning

            traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID
            for a

            user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to
            multiple

            conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights
            can lead

            to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second
            request has a

            different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be

            unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results
            to that

            client IDâ€™s search history, providing a richer experience for the
            user. Bing

            also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing
            the

            activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help
            with

            better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables
            higher

            click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although
            optional, you

            should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID
            across

            multiple requests for the same end user and device combination
            enables 1)

            the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2)
            higher

            click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing
            APIs. Each

            user that uses your application on the device must have a unique,
            Bing

            generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the
            request, Bing

            generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response
            header. The

            only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is
            the first

            time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for
            each Bing

            API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist
            the

            client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP
            cookie

            to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session
            cookie.

            For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent
            storage to

            persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device,
            get the

            client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include
            this

            header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID
            and use

            it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If
            you

            include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the
            request.

            by

            changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in
            the

            relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>.
            The

            following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location.
            lat

            (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The
            latitude

            must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to
            +90.0.

            Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values
            indicate

            northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's
            location,

            in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0
            and less

            than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes
            and

            positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The
            radius, in

            meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates.
            Pass the

            value returned by the device's location service. Typical values
            might be 22m

            for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for
            reverse IP

            lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was
            at the

            location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January
            1,

            1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction
            of

            travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through
            360,

            counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if
            the sp

            key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in
            meters

            per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The

            altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The
            radius, in

            meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates.
            Specify

            this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys
            are

            optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate
            the

            location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always

            specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is

            especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately
            reflect

            the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN).
            For

            optimal results, you should include this header and the 
            X-Search-ClientIP

            header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.

            The market where the results come from. You

            are strongly encouraged to always specify the market, if known.
            Specifying

            the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate
            and

            optimal response. This parameter and the cc query parameter are
            mutually

            exclusiveâ€”do not specify both.

            A unique ID that identifies this user

            session. Generate a unique value for each user session (the value is

            unimportant). The service uses the ID to help debug issues and

            The language to use for user interface

            strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language
            code.

            For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN

            (English). Although optional, you should always specify the
            language.

            Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt
            unless the

            user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different
            language.

            This parameter and the Accept-Language header are mutually
            exclusiveâ€”do not

            specify both. A user interface string is a string that's used as a
            label in

            a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
            response

            objects. Also, any links to Bing.com properties in the response
            objects

            apply the specified language.

            The type of spelling and grammar checks to

            perform. The following are the possible values (the values are case

            insensitive). The default is Proof. 1) Proofâ€”Finds most spelling and
            grammar

            mistakes. 2) Spellâ€”Finds most spelling mistakes but does not find
            some of

            the grammar errors that Proof catches (for example, capitalization
            and

            repeated words). Possible values include: 'Proof', 'Spell'

            A string that gives context to the

            text string. For example, the text string petal is valid. However,
            if you

            set preContextText to bike, the context changes and the text string
            becomes

            not valid. In this case, the API suggests that you change petal to
            pedal (as

            in bike pedal). This text is not checked for grammar or spelling
            errors. The

            combined length of the text string, preContextText string, and

            postContextText string may not exceed 10,000 characters. You may
            specify

            this parameter in the query string of a GET request or in the body
            of a POST

            request.

            postContextText to carpet, the context changes and the text string
            becomes

            not valid. In this case, the API suggests that you change read to
            red (as in

            red carpet). This text is not checked for grammar or spelling
            errors. The
