      Defines a suggested query string that likely represents the user's intent.
      The search results

      include this response if Bing determines that the user may have intended
      to search for something

      different. For example, if the user searches for alon brown, Bing may
      determine that the user

      likely intended to search for Alton Brown instead (based on past searches
      by others of Alon

      Brown).
