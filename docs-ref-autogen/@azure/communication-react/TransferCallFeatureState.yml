      'transferRequested'

      event. Only MAX_TRANSFER_REQUEST_LENGTH number of TransferRequest are kept
      in this array with the older ones being

      replaced by newer ones. To accept/reject a transfer request, the
      <xref:%40azure%2Fcommunication-calling%23Call> must be

      used (TODO: do we want to provide an API?).
