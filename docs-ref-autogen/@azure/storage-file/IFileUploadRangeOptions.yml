      An MD5 hash of the content. This hash is
      used to verify the integrity of the data during transport. When the
      Content-MD5 header is specified, the File service compares the hash of the
      content that has arrived with the header value that was sent. If the two
      hashes do not match, the operation will fail with error code 400 (Bad
