      Ranking function based on the Okapi BM25 similarity algorithm. BM25 is a
      TF-IDF-like algorithm

      that includes length normalization (controlled by the 'b' parameter) as
      well as term frequency

      saturation (controlled by the 'k1' parameter).

      This property controls how the length of a document affects the relevance
      score. By default, a

      value of 0.75 is used. A value of 0.0 means no length normalization is
      applied, while a value

      of 1.0 means the score is fully normalized by the length of the document.

      This property controls the scaling function between the term frequency of
      each matching terms

      and the final relevance score of a document-query pair. By default, a
      value of 1.2 is used. A

      value of 0.0 means the score does not scale with an increase in term
      frequency.
