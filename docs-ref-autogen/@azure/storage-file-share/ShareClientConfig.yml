    summary: >-
      The Files OAuth over REST feature requires special permissions to be
      included in the role definition to use

      These special permissions will give privileged access to file share data -

      It will allow users to bypass file/directory level ACL/NTFS permissions
      and get read/write access to file share data

      Since this additional permission can be unintended and to prevent
      unintended and over privileged access,

      additional checks has been implemented that requires users to explicitly
      indicate their intent to use these additional permissions.

      This is done using the fileRequestIntent option.

      Currently, the only value that the header supports is 'backup'

      Any user who wishes to use Files OAuth over REST feature has to call the
      API with the intent header. If the API is not called with the intent
      header, any subsequent data operation requests will be denied.
