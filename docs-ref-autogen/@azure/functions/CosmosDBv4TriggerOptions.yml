      When set, this property sets the maximum number of items received per
      Function call.

      If operations in the monitored container are performed through stored
      procedures, transaction scope is preserved when reading items from the
      change feed.

      As a result, the number of items received could be higher than the

      This option tells the Trigger to read changes from the beginning of the
      container's change history instead of starting at the current time.

      Reading from the beginning only works the first time the trigger starts,
      as in subsequent runs, the checkpoints are already stored.

      effect.
