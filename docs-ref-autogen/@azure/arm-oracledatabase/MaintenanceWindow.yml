      Weeks during the month when maintenance should be performed. Weeks start
      on the 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd days of the month, and have a duration of
      7 days. Weeks start and end based on calendar dates, not days of the week.
      For example, to allow maintenance during the 2nd week of the month (from
      the 8th day to the 14th day of the month), use the value 2. Maintenance
      cannot be scheduled for the fifth week of months that contain more than 28
      days. Note that this parameter works in conjunction with the  daysOfWeek
      and hoursOfDay parameters to allow you to specify specific days of the
      week and hours that maintenance will be performed.
