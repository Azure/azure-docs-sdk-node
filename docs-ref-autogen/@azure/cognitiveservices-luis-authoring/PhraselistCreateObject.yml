      An exchangeable phrase list feature are serves as single feature to the
      LUIS underlying

      training algorithm. It is used as a lexicon lookup feature where its value
      is 1 if the lexicon

      contains a given word or 0 if it doesnâ€™t. Think of an exchangeable as a
      synonyms list. A

      non-exchangeable phrase list feature has all the phrases in the list serve
      as separate

      features to the underlying training algorithm. So, if you your phrase list
      feature contains 5

      phrases, they will be mapped to 5 separate features. You can think of the
      non-exchangeable

      phrase list feature as an additional bag of words that you are willing to
      add to LUIS existing

      vocabulary features. Think of a non-exchangeable as set of different
      words. Default value is

      true. Default value: true.
