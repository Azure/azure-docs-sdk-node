      Specifies the type of information to log for debugging. The permitted
      values are none, requestContent, responseContent, or both requestContent
      and responseContent separated by a comma. The default is none. When
      setting this value, carefully consider the type of information that is
      being passed in during deployment. By logging information about the
      request or response, sensitive data that is retrieved through the
      deployment operations could potentially be exposed.
