      A region of the image that contains an entity. The values of the rectangle
      are relative to the

      width and height of the original image and are in the range 0.0 through
      1.0. For example, if

      the image is 300x200 and the region's top, left corner is at point (10,
      20) and the bottom,

      right corner is at point (290, 150), then the normalized rectangle is:
      Left =

      0.0333333333333333, Top = 0.1, Right = 0.9666666666666667, Bottom = 0.75.
      For people, the

      region represents the person's face.
