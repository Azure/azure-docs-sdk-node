      Specifies the type of information to log for debugging. The permitted
      values are none,

      requestContent, responseContent, or both requestContent and
      responseContent separated by a

      comma. The default is none. When setting this value, carefully consider
      the type of

      information you are passing in during deployment. By logging information
      about the request or

      response, you could potentially expose sensitive data that is retrieved
      through the deployment

      operations.
